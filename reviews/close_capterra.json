    "description": "Comments:We have a startup focused in ticket sales for events in Mexico. We were looking for in-depth data of our salesmen and to make easier for them to keep track of their clients by client type. We used a CRM (highrise), but the data it gave us was no longer enough to know more about whether the size and type of clients - and opportunities - our sales team were generating was the right kind given our current strategy.We initially requested a trial by importing a subset of random data of our former CRM but we felt this was not useful, because not all of those imported leads were relevant to us at the moment. When support from close.io gave us the option to extend our trial period, we deleted all of the previous leads and instead started adding new leads into the platform. That's when we notice the main strong point of close.io: by adding our first lead's email, within seconds we had a full history of each email we exchanged in the past. The desktop app works like a charm. Also, when you have a small sales team like ours, it's great to add a lead and check if one of your teammates already make a contact. Finally, it's amazing how easy is to categorize leads, we even use it to keep track of investors, allies and competitors. The call feature is also a huge breath of fresh air into a follow-up process. The fact you can make calls straight from the app, that those calls get recorded and also get tracked into a lead's history ensures automatic track of almost every kind of interaction with a lead. In our case, although we tried it and it worked great, we won't make use of it because our small office space forces us to do calls by getting outside the office, and given our internet connection is not that solid we will keep making calls the way we are right now and evaluate a full switch later.In a few words: if you have a small sales team and you want to make them doing more closing and less data insertion into follow-up tools, consider switching to close.io",

    "rating": 4,
    "pros": "The email auto-tracking is by far the the tool of close.io. The fact you can create a lead and it automatically brings all of the history of emails you exchanged with them gives a lot more insight and visibility into salesman follow-up performance. Also, the call feature; if you have a strong internet connection, and especially if you're a startup and your salespeople is constantly on the run. Support also responds very quickly to feedback, which made a lot easier the switch from our former CRM.",
    "cons": "For our business, itÂ´s very important to do bulk imports. However, the tool does not let you to opt out of duplicating leads, which makes us take longer to \"curate\" each file we want to import."

    "cons": "- Searching for data is near impossible. Can't filter for anything logically without getting into \"raw queries,\" so you better be half an engineer if you want to search for anything.\n- Reporting is a joke. The reporting tools might as well not exist. Be prepared to ask developers to leverage the API and sync into some other tool.\n- No matter what they may sell you, it's a CRM best used with small sales teams. It's not for account management or companies that expect anyone without an engineering degree to figure out how to analyze the data inside of it."

    "date": "9 years ago",
    "rating": 5,
    "pros": "Everything functioned flawlessly on the first try. I was able to set it up to use my domain name email. I imported all my contacts from Gmail. I could add customizations that would make it easy to keep track of my clients. \n\nThe search function knocked my socks off! I couldn't remember the name of a certain funding agency. Just by entering the client's name, it gave me the funding agency.\n\nClose.io was created for people trying to make an initial sale. I keep my clients three or four years and they often need a break from therapy for a few months. It was easy for me to give clients a status, such as \"paused\" or \"completed goals\".\n\nI was able to collect leads from my Wordpress website using Planso Forms. These create a new lead in Close.io.\n\nThe options to add a phone line and bulk email surprised me. I haven't seen this in any other CRMs. I can create email templates and send out messages to groups of people using my domain name email. The messages are plain text, which is just right for smart phones. \n\nI tried out the phone function on my computer. I have been using Magic Jack, and getting complaints from clients about MJ. The Close.io phone line is from Twilio and is much clearer. By installing the app on my phone, I can have a second phone number on my cell and I don't have to give clients my personal number.",
    "cons": "I'm in Canada. I wish the price wasn't so high, especially with the exchange rate.  \n\nAs an online therapy provider, I also have to pay for a telepractice platform and an online scheduler. If Close.io offered integration with Verishow and Accuity Scheduling, they would be able to offer a complete virtual office for online therapists, tutors, and coaches."

    "description": "Comments:While Close.io is a CRM by definition, I consider it more of a sales platform. I consider it as a platform because of it's flexible and rich API that allows you to customize any component. Close.io is a fantastic tool that teams should use for interacting with their customers. With built-in call and email integration, Close.io is designed for salesperson outreach. It eliminates unnecessary data entry, and is the perfect companion for any sales team using the \"Predictable Revenue\" (A book by Aaron Ross) approach to sales. All activity (calls, emails, lead status changes) is automatically tracked, leaving the sales rep to just write contextual notes for each activity.The automatic tracking of activity leads sales managers to easily determine how much activity yields certain sales results. Those answers are the holy grail when it comes to building a scalable sales process.",

It was a mess!!! Now we can do everything within the app itself. No more transferring information from one source to the other.",
    "date": "10 years ago",
    "rating": 5,
    "pros": "The features that helped us the most:\n\n-real-time integration with gmail. We send and receive all our email through the app. Besides being more convenient it also keeps all correspondence logged in an easy to reference way. \n-recorded calls - all calls and voice-mails are automatically listed right along with notes and emails. This is incredibly useful with longer sales cycles. We are able to go back and actually hear what the customer said on the call two months ago. So much better than just notes, especially if there is every a disagreement.  \n- Support is amazing. Always very responsive and timely and walked us through our limited implementation issues, (see below). Additionally, they are always improving the app, so about the time I suggest an option I'd like to see it is already slated to be rolled out.",
    "cons": "Not really any cons to speak of, but we had a couple issues at first:\n\n- call quality was poor. This was due to trying to use a wireless connection and after switching everyone over to wired, it went away. So while not an app problem, something to consider if you or your team work remotely.\n\n-Some merging issues when pulling lead data from our web form. Again, this was not an app problem so much as a developer problem on our end, but it was a headache for a couple days none the less."

My two cents: you should assess how well Close.io meets your needs before deciding that this is the right CRM (vs. a different CRM or a custom CRM if you're at higher volumes). Once you decide that it's worth exploring, my recommendation is to figure out how much you'll be paying in annual costs vs. a custom CRM implementation. Close.io pretty much won't prioritize features for you, so if you need anything custom done, I recommend going somewhere else.",

    "description": "Comments:I have used Close.IO at my past company and this is the only CRM that I can endorse. When I told my team that I was going to update the current CRM tool I was met with a lot of questions and concerns. After showing the video on the Close.IO site and taking questions for about 20 mins my team was buying into the idea of changing over. I was also able to prove to them that there would be a minimum of an hour that each of them would save a day, so that peaked their interest. Then as we ramped up for the change the nervousness kicked in again, so I made sure to stage the rollout in an effort to handle all questions in a controlled manner and prepare for more users. The employees were blown away by the ease of use! And I was impressed at just how smooth it all went. Being a tech guy my learning curve is quick, but from employees in their 20's-50's we had a hugely successful transition into Close.IO.While my team is still early in the game, about 3 weeks into Close, we are seeing AMAZING results. One of my sales guys is up 50% in his personal sales! Others are up 10-20%. My entire team has said that they cannot wait to see what the future holds as we are continuing to find more ways to improve our process. Close.IO has convinced my team that it is the choice CRM tool.",

    "description": "Comments:I can tell you that I have used over 20 different CRM systems over the past 10 years. We do a tone of cold calling and we need to just blaze through calls fast and I never could find CRM that allowed us to do this.  I was so frustrated that I needed up even creating our own CRM just to do this very thing.  I canât tell you how much money I spent in development of our CRM to make a product that blazes through calls fast.  We used that for about a year or two then I stumbled on because our in-house custom CRM was having problems and we didn't have the resources to fix it so I figured I would try again.  I cannot tell you how incredibly excited I am about how amazing Stop logging calls and emails and start making them instead. truly is. This CRM is unlike any product on the market it is exactly what we wanted our in-house product to be and more.  Itâs so awesome we scrapped our in house product and started exclusively using Stop logging calls and emails and start making them instead.. You do not truly have an appreciation for ânext genâ this thing really is, there is literally nothing like it on the market and honestly Iâm a bit shocked no one seems to get the amazing this thing is.  This is a pure sales communication tool that cuts out all the BS of a CRM and is a real actual tool that a sales person can use to increase their sales and not just some data collection thing that salespeople are forced to you.  If you actually give a go and start using it youâll never want to use anything else if you do cold calling.  The thing seamlessly interfaces all your calls AND even all your emails!  You no longer need to be jumping in and out of outlook, you donât need to check your outlook or Gmail calendar, and you donât need to do anything except pull up the Stop logging calls and emails and start making them instead. and do the stuff in your inbox and make money.  It pulls in not only your tasks, and follow up meetings but it also syncs your emails and voicemail sand phone calls.  It takes every single bit of communication you do and puts it in one quick âto do listâ automatically with ZERO data entry.  Itâs blazing fast and it just works.   The voicemail drop thing is really dope, I canât tell you how many times a day I find myself having to leave voice mails for people, they have this thing that you hit a button and it automatically leaves a voicemail so you can go to the next call, just amazing in terms of productivity.",

    "rating": 5,
    "pros": "There are too many to list â If you do cold calls this is a no brainier, you need to buy it today!  It support The best apps. Better together. as well which means it hooks into hundreds of other marketing tools also.  Their support is second to none, these guys seems to be hustling hard with support, product development and just providing a kick ass experience for their customers. I recommend this product.",
    "cons": "This thing is EXPENSIVE.. but the truth is you get what you pay for and you geta lot.  Your paying for the best and it has a price tag which clearly says itâs the best because itâs more than double the cost of other competitive products. The downside is though I have 3 team members and Iâm paying close $300 to $400 a month for 3 people thatâs crazy considering there are other products that do VoIp with Twillio for less than $10 a user. So I went from paying $50 a month for CRM and $80 for Twillio VoIP($180) to $300 a month.  So my prices doubled, which sucked however after using this product it is worth the extra price but if they raise the prices anymore that is just pushing because it really his priced rather high for the market itâs in.   Even the enterprise âSForceâ CRMs are not as expensive as that (course those CRMssuck compared to this when it comes to cold calling).  The problem is I canât easily scale with it.  So Iâll be stuck with a 3 users fora while where if they had it at a lower price point I would buy a license fore very one of my staff but since itâs so expensive I canât justify it for anyone but my sales people.   I think they are missing out on revenue by not having license does not have the VoIP stuff for like $5 a user so my support team could use it without VoIP and be on par with other CRM price\n\npoints.  Itâs clear though this is a nitch product for telephone sales teams.\n\nSO that being said if you do not do a lot of phone sales then this product is probably overkill for you and there are many others that are more of âclient managerâtype of product where this bad boy is a pure sales beast and nothing else.. It will help increase your sales without a doubt!  In terms of client management and being asingle point for all customer data it does the job but it does not really do that any better than other products out on the market for half its cost.  Itâs really the phone cold calling stuff is what makes it so awesome so if any other CRM companies ever figure this out and try to clone/copy it they will have some real competition but so far there is nothing like it and I would buy all over again!  Also I really never write reviews either so the fact Iâm even doing this speaks to much this thing rocks!"

    "description": "Comments:Love how simple Close.IO is.  There's one list of contacts , and then an infinite ways of segmenting the data after that in powerful ways.  It's a very powerful concept, and they do it in a way that makes it super easy to manage lists of leads/clients/whatever, and to help make sure you're on top of it.  They do this, however, in my opinion, by sacrificing features available in other top CRMs, some that seem like they should just be there.  For us it has been worthwhile nonetheless.",
    "date": "9 years ago",
    "rating": 4,
    "pros": "By far the easiest and most intuitive way to manage relationships that I've come across.  If it's a big struggle for you to have a bunch of lists of leads, and with your limited time you struggle to stay on top of each and every one of them, then Close.IO is awesome.  It has helped us make sure none fall through the cracks, and does that in a way where I don't have to think about it.  It just lets me know.  Integration through Zapier also brings it to another level of automating workflows.",
    "cons": "It's missing some features that other CRMs have, especially for the price.  Although the 'smart views' (how you segment the contacts into different lists) is really really awesome and VERY powerful, there are some limitations that sound like should be there but are just missing (e.g. having different default columns per 'smart view', which sounds like a given to me since someone cares about different data depending on if the contact is a cold lead, qualified lead, or client).  Instead now I have a bunch of columns that some people within my company don't care about but are just confusing to them.\n\nAlso, you have to get the pro/business to get several features that I initially expected would be part of the main one, e.g. there's not a single report that can draw a graph to visually get at-a-glance info of any kind in the basic version.  They also don't post their roadmap openly, so I have no idea what features will be coming.\n\nSo in this respect it feels slightly like an incomplete product, but as mentioned, worth it for how incredibly well they execute the main function we need it for (effectively managing relationships/lists of contacts for both sales and client relationships)."

    "description": "Comments:We have a startup focused in ticket sales for events in Mexico. We were looking for in-depth data of our salesmen and to make easier for them to keep track of their clients by client type. We used a CRM (highrise), but the data it gave us was no longer enough to know more about whether the size and type of clients - and opportunities - our sales team were generating was the right kind given our current strategy.We initially requested a trial by importing a subset of random data of our former CRM but we felt this was not useful, because not all of those imported leads were relevant to us at the moment. When support from close.io gave us the option to extend our trial period, we deleted all of the previous leads and instead started adding new leads into the platform. That's when we notice the main strong point of close.io: by adding our first lead's email, within seconds we had a full history of each email we exchanged in the past. The desktop app works like a charm. Also, when you have a small sales team like ours, it's great to add a lead and check if one of your teammates already make a contact. Finally, it's amazing how easy is to categorize leads, we even use it to keep track of investors, allies and competitors. The call feature is also a huge breath of fresh air into a follow-up process. The fact you can make calls straight from the app, that those calls get recorded and also get tracked into a lead's history ensures automatic track of almost every kind of interaction with a lead. In our case, although we tried it and it worked great, we won't make use of it because our small office space forces us to do calls by getting outside the office, and given our internet connection is not that solid we will keep making calls the way we are right now and evaluate a full switch later.In a few words: if you have a small sales team and you want to make them doing more closing and less data insertion into follow-up tools, consider switching to close.io",

    "pros": "The email auto-tracking is by far the the tool of close.io.

Support also responds very quickly to feedback, which made a lot easier the switch from our former CRM.",

Just by entering the client's name, it gave me the funding agency.\n\nClose.io was created for people trying to make an initial sale. I keep my clients three or four years and they often need a break from therapy for a few months. It was easy for me to give clients a status, such as \"paused\" or \"completed goals\".\n\nI was able to collect leads from my Wordpress website using Planso Forms. These create a new lead in Close.io.\n\nThe options to add a phone line and bulk email surprised me. I haven't seen this in any other CRMs. I can create email templates and send out messages to groups of people using my domain name email. The messages are plain text, which is just right for smart phones. \n\nI tried out the phone function on my computer. I have been using Magic Jack, and getting complaints from clients about MJ. The Close.io phone line is from Twilio and is much clearer. By installing the app on my phone, I can have a second phone number on my cell and I don't have to give clients my personal number.",

My two cents: you should assess how well Close.io meets your needs before deciding that this is the right CRM (vs. a different CRM or a custom CRM if you're at higher volumes). Once you decide that it's worth exploring, my recommendation is to figure out how much you'll be paying in annual costs vs. a custom CRM implementation.

When I told my team that I was going to update the current CRM tool I was met with a lot of questions and concerns.

I was also able to prove to them that there would be a minimum of an hour that each of them would save a day, so that peaked their interest. Then as we ramped up for the change the nervousness kicked in again, so I made sure to stage the rollout in an effort to handle all questions in a controlled manner and prepare for more users. The employees were blown away by the ease of use! And I was impressed at just how smooth it all went. Being a tech guy my learning curve is quick, but from employees in their 20's-50's we had a hugely successful transition into Close.IO.While my team is still early in the game, about 3 weeks into Close, we are seeing AMAZING results.

We do a tone of cold calling and we need to just blaze through calls fast and I never could find CRM that allowed us to do this.  I was so frustrated that I needed up even creating our own CRM just to do this very thing.  I canât tell you how much money I spent in development of our CRM to make a product that blazes through calls fast.  We used that for about a year or two then I stumbled on because our in-house custom CRM was having problems and we didn't have the resources to fix it so I figured I would try again.  I cannot tell you how incredibly excited I am about how amazing Stop logging calls and emails and start making them instead. truly is. This CRM is unlike any product on the market it is exactly what we wanted our in-house product to be and more.  Itâs so awesome we scrapped our in house product and started exclusively using Stop logging calls and emails and start making them instead.. You do not truly have an appreciation for ânext genâ this thing really is, there is literally nothing like it on the market and honestly Iâm a bit shocked no one seems to get the amazing this thing is.  This is a pure sales communication tool that cuts out all the BS of a CRM and is a real actual tool that a sales person can use to increase their sales and not just some data collection thing that salespeople are forced to you.  If you actually give a go and start using it youâll never want to use anything else if you do cold calling.  The thing seamlessly interfaces all your calls AND even all your emails!  You no longer need to be jumping in and out of outlook, you donât need to check your outlook or Gmail calendar, and you donât need to do anything except pull up the Stop logging calls and emails and start making them instead. and do the stuff in your inbox and make money.  It pulls in not only your tasks, and follow up meetings but it also syncs your emails and voicemail sand phone calls.  It takes every single bit of communication you do and puts it in one quick âto do listâ automatically with ZERO data entry.  Itâs blazing fast and it just works.   The voicemail drop thing is really dope, I canât tell you how many times a day I find myself having to leave voice mails for people, they have this thing that you hit a button and it automatically leaves a voicemail so you can go to the next call, just amazing in terms of productivity.",

Their support is second to none, these guys seems to be hustling hard with support, product development and just providing a kick ass experience for their customers. I recommend this product.",
    "cons": "This thing is EXPENSIVE.. but the truth is you get what you pay for and you geta lot.  Your paying for the best and it has a price tag which clearly says itâs the best because itâs more than double the cost of other competitive products. The downside is though I have 3 team members and Iâm paying close $300 to $400 a month for 3 people thatâs crazy considering there are other products that do VoIp with Twillio for less than $10 a user. So I went from paying $50 a month for CRM and $80 for Twillio VoIP($180) to $300 a month.  So my prices doubled, which sucked however after using this product it is worth the extra price but if they raise the prices anymore that is just pushing because it really his priced rather high for the market itâs in.   Even the enterprise âSForceâ CRMs are not as expensive as that (course those CRMssuck compared to this when it comes to cold calling).  The problem is I canât easily scale with it.  So Iâll be stuck with a 3 users fora while where if they had it at a lower price point I would buy a license fore very one of my staff but since itâs so expensive I canât justify it for anyone but my sales people.   I think they are missing out on revenue by not having license does not have the VoIP stuff for like $5 a user so my support team could use it without VoIP and be on par with other CRM price\n\npoints.  Itâs clear though this is a nitch product for telephone sales teams.\n\nSO that being said if you do not do a lot of phone sales then this product is probably overkill for you and there are many others that are more of âclient managerâtype of product where this bad boy is a pure sales beast and nothing else.. It will help increase your sales without a doubt!  In terms of client management and being asingle point for all customer data it does the job but it does not really do that any better than other products out on the market for half its cost.  Itâs really the phone cold calling stuff is what makes it so awesome so if any other CRM companies ever figure this out and try to clone/copy it they will have some real competition but so far there is nothing like it and I would buy all over again!  Also I really never write reviews either so the fact Iâm even doing this speaks to much this thing rocks!"

If it's a big struggle for you to have a bunch of lists of leads, and with your limited time you struggle to stay on top of each and every one of them, then Close.IO is awesome.  It has helped us make sure none fall through the cracks, and does that in a way where I don't have to think about it.  It just lets me know.  Integration through Zapier also brings it to another level of automating workflows.",
    "cons": "It's missing some features that other CRMs have, especially for the price.  Although the 'smart views' (how you segment the contacts into different lists) is really really awesome and VERY powerful, there are some limitations that sound like should be there but are just missing (e.g. having different default columns per 'smart view', which sounds like a given to me since someone cares about different data depending on if the contact is a cold lead, qualified lead, or client).  Instead now I have a bunch of columns that some people within my company don't care about but are just confusing to them.\n\nAlso, you have to get the pro/business to get several features that I initially expected would be part of the main one, e.g. there's not a single report that can draw a graph to visually get at-a-glance info of any kind in the basic version.  They also don't post their roadmap openly, so I have no idea what features will be coming.\n\nSo in this respect it feels slightly like an incomplete product, but as mentioned, worth it for how incredibly well they execute the main function we need it for (effectively managing relationships/lists of contacts for both sales and client relationships)."

The ability to add custom fields to all leads in combination with the bulk email feature makes it possible to easily send hundreds of personalised emails in seconds. I would recommend close.io to anyone who wants to maintain and grow a database of contacts, be it customers, candidates or investors.",

With our HQ in Europe, and a sales team poised to expand rapidly worldwide, we needed the ability to \"speak\" to each other by having access to all leads in the system and their history. Right now we are piloting Close.io here in the U.S. with a couple of sales people also trying it in Europe. We integrated our incoming leads from our system into close.io via Zapier and all communication via Gmail. It was a snap! Also, the support team can CC or BCC close.io on crucial matters via the ticket system and sales can now see all important transactions in one place. Just in a few short months Sales productivity has changed dramatically, and basically, I'm a happier person, which is good for everyone!",

    "description": "Comments:We have a startup focused in ticket sales for events in Mexico. We were looking for in-depth data of our salesmen and to make easier for them to keep track of their clients by client type. We used a CRM (highrise), but the data it gave us was no longer enough to know more about whether the size and type of clients - and opportunities - our sales team were generating was the right kind given our current strategy.We initially requested a trial by importing a subset of random data of our former CRM but we felt this was not useful, because not all of those imported leads were relevant to us at the moment. When support from close.io gave us the option to extend our trial period, we deleted all of the previous leads and instead started adding new leads into the platform. That's when we notice the main strong point of close.io: by adding our first lead's email, within seconds we had a full history of each email we exchanged in the past. The desktop app works like a charm. Also, when you have a small sales team like ours, it's great to add a lead and check if one of your teammates already make a contact. Finally, it's amazing how easy is to categorize leads, we even use it to keep track of investors, allies and competitors. The call feature is also a huge breath of fresh air into a follow-up process. The fact you can make calls straight from the app, that those calls get recorded and also get tracked into a lead's history ensures automatic track of almost every kind of interaction with a lead. In our case, although we tried it and it worked great, we won't make use of it because our small office space forces us to do calls by getting outside the office, and given our internet connection is not that solid we will keep making calls the way we are right now and evaluate a full switch later.In a few words: if you have a small sales team and you want to make them doing more closing and less data insertion into follow-up tools, consider switching to close.io",

Support also responds very quickly to feedback, which made a lot easier the switch from our former CRM.",

Just by entering the client's name, it gave me the funding agency.\n\nClose.io was created for people trying to make an initial sale. I keep my clients three or four years and they often need a break from therapy for a few months. It was easy for me to give clients a status, such as \"paused\" or \"completed goals\".\n\nI was able to collect leads from my Wordpress website using Planso Forms. These create a new lead in Close.io.\n\nThe options to add a phone line and bulk email surprised me. I haven't seen this in any other CRMs. I can create email templates and send out messages to groups of people using my domain name email. The messages are plain text, which is just right for smart phones. \n\nI tried out the phone function on my computer. I have been using Magic Jack, and getting complaints from clients about MJ. The Close.io phone line is from Twilio and is much clearer. By installing the app on my phone, I can have a second phone number on my cell and I don't have to give clients my personal number.",

My two cents: you should assess how well Close.io meets your needs before deciding that this is the right CRM (vs. a different CRM or a custom CRM if you're at higher volumes). Once you decide that it's worth exploring, my recommendation is to figure out how much you'll be paying in annual costs vs. a custom CRM implementation.

I was also able to prove to them that there would be a minimum of an hour that each of them would save a day, so that peaked their interest. Then as we ramped up for the change the nervousness kicked in again, so I made sure to stage the rollout in an effort to handle all questions in a controlled manner and prepare for more users.

We do a tone of cold calling and we need to just blaze through calls fast and I never could find CRM that allowed us to do this.  I was so frustrated that I needed up even creating our own CRM just to do this very thing.  I canât tell you how much money I spent in development of our CRM to make a product that blazes through calls fast.  We used that for about a year or two then I stumbled on because our in-house custom CRM was having problems and we didn't have the resources to fix it so I figured I would try again.  I cannot tell you how incredibly excited I am about how amazing Stop logging calls and emails and start making them instead. truly is. This CRM is unlike any product on the market it is exactly what we wanted our in-house product to be and more.  Itâs so awesome we scrapped our in house product and started exclusively using Stop logging calls and emails and start making them instead.. You do not truly have an appreciation for ânext genâ this thing really is, there is literally nothing like it on the market and honestly Iâm a bit shocked no one seems to get the amazing this thing is.  This is a pure sales communication tool that cuts out all the BS of a CRM and is a real actual tool that a sales person can use to increase their sales and not just some data collection thing that salespeople are forced to you.  If you actually give a go and start using it youâll never want to use anything else if you do cold calling.  The thing seamlessly interfaces all your calls AND even all your emails!  You no longer need to be jumping in and out of outlook, you donât need to check your outlook or Gmail calendar, and you donât need to do anything except pull up the Stop logging calls and emails and start making them instead. and do the stuff in your inbox and make money.  It pulls in not only your tasks, and follow up meetings but it also syncs your emails and voicemail sand phone calls.  It takes every single bit of communication you do and puts it in one quick âto do listâ automatically with ZERO data entry.  Itâs blazing fast and it just works.   The voicemail drop thing is really dope, I canât tell you how many times a day I find myself having to leave voice mails for people, they have this thing that you hit a button and it automatically leaves a voicemail so you can go to the next call, just amazing in terms of productivity.",

Their support is second to none, these guys seems to be hustling hard with support, product development and just providing a kick ass experience for their customers. I recommend this product.",
    "cons": "This thing is EXPENSIVE.. but the truth is you get what you pay for and you geta lot.  Your paying for the best and it has a price tag which clearly says itâs the best because itâs more than double the cost of other competitive products. The downside is though I have 3 team members and Iâm paying close $300 to $400 a month for 3 people thatâs crazy considering there are other products that do VoIp with Twillio for less than $10 a user. So I went from paying $50 a month for CRM and $80 for Twillio VoIP($180) to $300 a month.  So my prices doubled, which sucked however after using this product it is worth the extra price but if they raise the prices anymore that is just pushing because it really his priced rather high for the market itâs in.   Even the enterprise âSForceâ CRMs are not as expensive as that (course those CRMssuck compared to this when it comes to cold calling).  The problem is I canât easily scale with it.  So Iâll be stuck with a 3 users fora while where if they had it at a lower price point I would buy a license fore very one of my staff but since itâs so expensive I canât justify it for anyone but my sales people.   I think they are missing out on revenue by not having license does not have the VoIP stuff for like $5 a user so my support team could use it without VoIP and be on par with other CRM price\n\npoints.  Itâs clear though this is a nitch product for telephone sales teams.\n\nSO that being said if you do not do a lot of phone sales then this product is probably overkill for you and there are many others that are more of âclient managerâtype of product where this bad boy is a pure sales beast and nothing else.. It will help increase your sales without a doubt!  In terms of client management and being asingle point for all customer data it does the job but it does not really do that any better than other products out on the market for half its cost.  Itâs really the phone cold calling stuff is what makes it so awesome so if any other CRM companies ever figure this out and try to clone/copy it they will have some real competition but so far there is nothing like it and I would buy all over again!  Also I really never write reviews either so the fact Iâm even doing this speaks to much this thing rocks!"

It's a very powerful concept, and they do it in a way that makes it super easy to manage lists of leads/clients/whatever, and to help make sure you're on top of it.

If it's a big struggle for you to have a bunch of lists of leads, and with your limited time you struggle to stay on top of each and every one of them, then Close.IO is awesome.  It has helped us make sure none fall through the cracks, and does that in a way where I don't have to think about it.  It just lets me know.  Integration through Zapier also brings it to another level of automating workflows.",
    "cons": "It's missing some features that other CRMs have, especially for the price.  Although the 'smart views' (how you segment the contacts into different lists) is really really awesome and VERY powerful, there are some limitations that sound like should be there but are just missing (e.g. having different default columns per 'smart view', which sounds like a given to me since someone cares about different data depending on if the contact is a cold lead, qualified lead, or client).  Instead now I have a bunch of columns that some people within my company don't care about but are just confusing to them.\n\nAlso, you have to get the pro/business to get several features that I initially expected would be part of the main one, e.g. there's not a single report that can draw a graph to visually get at-a-glance info of any kind in the basic version.  They also don't post their roadmap openly, so I have no idea what features will be coming.\n\nSo in this respect it feels slightly like an incomplete product, but as mentioned, worth it for how incredibly well they execute the main function we need it for (effectively managing relationships/lists of contacts for both sales and client relationships)."

    "description": "Comments:We have a startup focused in ticket sales for events in Mexico. We were looking for in-depth data of our salesmen and to make easier for them to keep track of their clients by client type. We used a CRM (highrise), but the data it gave us was no longer enough to know more about whether the size and type of clients - and opportunities - our sales team were generating was the right kind given our current strategy.We initially requested a trial by importing a subset of random data of our former CRM but we felt this was not useful, because not all of those imported leads were relevant to us at the moment. When support from close.io gave us the option to extend our trial period, we deleted all of the previous leads and instead started adding new leads into the platform. That's when we notice the main strong point of close.io: by adding our first lead's email, within seconds we had a full history of each email we exchanged in the past. The desktop app works like a charm. Also, when you have a small sales team like ours, it's great to add a lead and check if one of your teammates already make a contact. Finally, it's amazing how easy is to categorize leads, we even use it to keep track of investors, allies and competitors. The call feature is also a huge breath of fresh air into a follow-up process. The fact you can make calls straight from the app, that those calls get recorded and also get tracked into a lead's history ensures automatic track of almost every kind of interaction with a lead. In our case, although we tried it and it worked great, we won't make use of it because our small office space forces us to do calls by getting outside the office, and given our internet connection is not that solid we will keep making calls the way we are right now and evaluate a full switch later.In a few words: if you have a small sales team and you want to make them doing more closing and less data insertion into follow-up tools, consider switching to close.io",

Support also responds very quickly to feedback, which made a lot easier the switch from our former CRM.",

Just by entering the client's name, it gave me the funding agency.\n\nClose.io was created for people trying to make an initial sale. I keep my clients three or four years and they often need a break from therapy for a few months. It was easy for me to give clients a status, such as \"paused\" or \"completed goals\".\n\nI was able to collect leads from my Wordpress website using Planso Forms. These create a new lead in Close.io.\n\nThe options to add a phone line and bulk email surprised me. I haven't seen this in any other CRMs. I can create email templates and send out messages to groups of people using my domain name email. The messages are plain text, which is just right for smart phones. \n\nI tried out the phone function on my computer. I have been using Magic Jack, and getting complaints from clients about MJ. The Close.io phone line is from Twilio and is much clearer. By installing the app on my phone, I can have a second phone number on my cell and I don't have to give clients my personal number.",

My two cents: you should assess how well Close.io meets your needs before deciding that this is the right CRM (vs. a different CRM or a custom CRM if you're at higher volumes). Once you decide that it's worth exploring, my recommendation is to figure out how much you'll be paying in annual costs vs. a custom CRM implementation.

We do a tone of cold calling and we need to just blaze through calls fast and I never could find CRM that allowed us to do this.  I was so frustrated that I needed up even creating our own CRM just to do this very thing.  I canât tell you how much money I spent in development of our CRM to make a product that blazes through calls fast.  We used that for about a year or two then I stumbled on because our in-house custom CRM was having problems and we didn't have the resources to fix it so I figured I would try again.  I cannot tell you how incredibly excited I am about how amazing Stop logging calls and emails and start making them instead. truly is. This CRM is unlike any product on the market it is exactly what we wanted our in-house product to be and more.  Itâs so awesome we scrapped our in house product and started exclusively using Stop logging calls and emails and start making them instead.. You do not truly have an appreciation for ânext genâ this thing really is, there is literally nothing like it on the market and honestly Iâm a bit shocked no one seems to get the amazing this thing is.  This is a pure sales communication tool that cuts out all the BS of a CRM and is a real actual tool that a sales person can use to increase their sales and not just some data collection thing that salespeople are forced to you.  If you actually give a go and start using it youâll never want to use anything else if you do cold calling.  The thing seamlessly interfaces all your calls AND even all your emails!  You no longer need to be jumping in and out of outlook, you donât need to check your outlook or Gmail calendar, and you donât need to do anything except pull up the Stop logging calls and emails and start making them instead. and do the stuff in your inbox and make money.  It pulls in not only your tasks, and follow up meetings but it also syncs your emails and voicemail sand phone calls.  It takes every single bit of communication you do and puts it in one quick âto do listâ automatically with ZERO data entry.  Itâs blazing fast and it just works.   The voicemail drop thing is really dope, I canât tell you how many times a day I find myself having to leave voice mails for people, they have this thing that you hit a button and it automatically leaves a voicemail so you can go to the next call, just amazing in terms of productivity.",

Their support is second to none, these guys seems to be hustling hard with support, product development and just providing a kick ass experience for their customers. I recommend this product.",
    "cons": "This thing is EXPENSIVE.. but the truth is you get what you pay for and you geta lot.  Your paying for the best and it has a price tag which clearly says itâs the best because itâs more than double the cost of other competitive products. The downside is though I have 3 team members and Iâm paying close $300 to $400 a month for 3 people thatâs crazy considering there are other products that do VoIp with Twillio for less than $10 a user. So I went from paying $50 a month for CRM and $80 for Twillio VoIP($180) to $300 a month.  So my prices doubled, which sucked however after using this product it is worth the extra price but if they raise the prices anymore that is just pushing because it really his priced rather high for the market itâs in.   Even the enterprise âSForceâ CRMs are not as expensive as that (course those CRMssuck compared to this when it comes to cold calling).  The problem is I canât easily scale with it.  So Iâll be stuck with a 3 users fora while where if they had it at a lower price point I would buy a license fore very one of my staff but since itâs so expensive I canât justify it for anyone but my sales people.   I think they are missing out on revenue by not having license does not have the VoIP stuff for like $5 a user so my support team could use it without VoIP and be on par with other CRM price\n\npoints.  Itâs clear though this is a nitch product for telephone sales teams.\n\nSO that being said if you do not do a lot of phone sales then this product is probably overkill for you and there are many others that are more of âclient managerâtype of product where this bad boy is a pure sales beast and nothing else.. It will help increase your sales without a doubt!  In terms of client management and being asingle point for all customer data it does the job but it does not really do that any better than other products out on the market for half its cost.  Itâs really the phone cold calling stuff is what makes it so awesome so if any other CRM companies ever figure this out and try to clone/copy it they will have some real competition but so far there is nothing like it and I would buy all over again!  Also I really never write reviews either so the fact Iâm even doing this speaks to much this thing rocks!"

Although the 'smart views' (how you segment the contacts into different lists) is really really awesome and VERY powerful, there are some limitations that sound like should be there but are just missing (e.g. having different default columns per 'smart view', which sounds like a given to me since someone cares about different data depending on if the contact is a cold lead, qualified lead, or client).  Instead now I have a bunch of columns that some people within my company don't care about but are just confusing to them.\n\nAlso, you have to get the pro/business to get several features that I initially expected would be part of the main one, e.g. there's not a single report that can draw a graph to visually get at-a-glance info of any kind in the basic version.  They also don't post their roadmap openly, so I have no idea what features will be coming.\n\nSo in this respect it feels slightly like an incomplete product, but as mentioned, worth it for how incredibly well they execute the main function we need it for (effectively managing relationships/lists of contacts for both sales and client relationships)."

The notes are chaotic and very difficult to look back through history and find important past conversations.  There is no ability to do ANY form of contract management once a customer is closed and there is also no ability to attach anything to the opportunity info.  So if you have a relevant presentation or any documentation relevant to a potential sale you best save it in a google drive and make a custom field to stick the link in."

    "description": "Comments:We have a startup focused in ticket sales for events in Mexico. We were looking for in-depth data of our salesmen and to make easier for them to keep track of their clients by client type. We used a CRM (highrise), but the data it gave us was no longer enough to know more about whether the size and type of clients - and opportunities - our sales team were generating was the right kind given our current strategy.We initially requested a trial by importing a subset of random data of our former CRM but we felt this was not useful, because not all of those imported leads were relevant to us at the moment. When support from close.io gave us the option to extend our trial period, we deleted all of the previous leads and instead started adding new leads into the platform. That's when we notice the main strong point of close.io: by adding our first lead's email, within seconds we had a full history of each email we exchanged in the past. The desktop app works like a charm. Also, when you have a small sales team like ours, it's great to add a lead and check if one of your teammates already make a contact. Finally, it's amazing how easy is to categorize leads, we even use it to keep track of investors, allies and competitors. The call feature is also a huge breath of fresh air into a follow-up process. The fact you can make calls straight from the app, that those calls get recorded and also get tracked into a lead's history ensures automatic track of almost every kind of interaction with a lead. In our case, although we tried it and it worked great, we won't make use of it because our small office space forces us to do calls by getting outside the office, and given our internet connection is not that solid we will keep making calls the way we are right now and evaluate a full switch later.In a few words: if you have a small sales team and you want to make them doing more closing and less data insertion into follow-up tools, consider switching to close.io",

Support also responds very quickly to feedback, which made a lot easier the switch from our former CRM.",

These create a new lead in Close.io.\n\nThe options to add a phone line and bulk email surprised me. I haven't seen this in any other CRMs. I can create email templates and send out messages to groups of people using my domain name email. The messages are plain text, which is just right for smart phones. \n\nI tried out the phone function on my computer. I have been using Magic Jack, and getting complaints from clients about MJ. The Close.io phone line is from Twilio and is much clearer. By installing the app on my phone, I can have a second phone number on my cell and I don't have to give clients my personal number.",

I was so frustrated that I needed up even creating our own CRM just to do this very thing.  I canât tell you how much money I spent in development of our CRM to make a product that blazes through calls fast.  We used that for about a year or two then I stumbled on because our in-house custom CRM was having problems and we didn't have the resources to fix it so I figured I would try again.  I cannot tell you how incredibly excited I am about how amazing Stop logging calls and emails and start making them instead. truly is. This CRM is unlike any product on the market it is exactly what we wanted our in-house product to be and more.  Itâs so awesome we scrapped our in house product and started exclusively using Stop logging calls and emails and start making them instead.. You do not truly have an appreciation for ânext genâ this thing really is, there is literally nothing like it on the market and honestly Iâm a bit shocked no one seems to get the amazing this thing is.  This is a pure sales communication tool that cuts out all the BS of a CRM and is a real actual tool that a sales person can use to increase their sales and not just some data collection thing that salespeople are forced to you.  If you actually give a go and start using it youâll never want to use anything else if you do cold calling.  The thing seamlessly interfaces all your calls AND even all your emails!  You no longer need to be jumping in and out of outlook, you donât need to check your outlook or Gmail calendar, and you donât need to do anything except pull up the Stop logging calls and emails and start making them instead. and do the stuff in your inbox and make money.  It pulls in not only your tasks, and follow up meetings but it also syncs your emails and voicemail sand phone calls.  It takes every single bit of communication you do and puts it in one quick âto do listâ automatically with ZERO data entry.  Itâs blazing fast and it just works.

So my prices doubled, which sucked however after using this product it is worth the extra price but if they raise the prices anymore that is just pushing because it really his priced rather high for the market itâs in.   Even the enterprise âSForceâ CRMs are not as expensive as that (course those CRMssuck compared to this when it comes to cold calling).  The problem is I canât easily scale with it.  So Iâll be stuck with a 3 users fora while where if they had it at a lower price point I would buy a license fore very one of my staff but since itâs so expensive I canât justify it for anyone but my sales people.   I think they are missing out on revenue by not having license does not have the VoIP stuff for like $5 a user so my support team could use it without VoIP and be on par with other CRM price\n\npoints.  Itâs clear though this is a nitch product for telephone sales teams.\n\nSO that being said if you do not do a lot of phone sales then this product is probably overkill for you and there are many others that are more of âclient managerâtype of product where this bad boy is a pure sales beast and nothing else.. It will help increase your sales without a doubt!  In terms of client management and being asingle point for all customer data it does the job but it does not really do that any better than other products out on the market for half its cost.  Itâs really the phone cold calling stuff is what makes it so awesome so if any other CRM companies ever figure this out and try to clone/copy it they will have some real competition but so far there is nothing like it and I would buy all over again!  Also I really never write reviews either so the fact Iâm even doing this speaks to much this thing rocks!"

    "description": "Comments:Love how simple Close.IO is.  There's one list of contacts , and then an infinite ways of segmenting the data after that in powerful ways.  It's a very powerful concept, and they do it in a way that makes it super easy to manage lists of leads/clients/whatever, and to help make sure you're on top of it.  They do this, however, in my opinion, by sacrificing features available in other top CRMs, some that seem like they should just be there.  For us it has been worthwhile nonetheless.",

    "pros": "By far the easiest and most intuitive way to manage relationships that I've come across.  If it's a big struggle for you to have a bunch of lists of leads, and with your limited time you struggle to stay on top of each and every one of them, then Close.IO is awesome.  It has helped us make sure none fall through the cracks, and does that in a way where I don't have to think about it.  It just lets me know.  Integration through Zapier also brings it to another level of automating workflows.",
    "cons": "It's missing some features that other CRMs have, especially for the price.  Although the 'smart views' (how you segment the contacts into different lists) is really really awesome and VERY powerful, there are some limitations that sound like should be there but are just missing (e.g. having different default columns per 'smart view', which sounds like a given to me since someone cares about different data depending on if the contact is a cold lead, qualified lead, or client).  Instead now I have a bunch of columns that some people within my company don't care about but are just confusing to them.\n\nAlso, you have to get the pro/business to get several features that I initially expected would be part of the main one, e.g. there's not a single report that can draw a graph to visually get at-a-glance info of any kind in the basic version.  They also don't post their roadmap openly, so I have no idea what features will be coming.\n\nSo in this respect it feels slightly like an incomplete product, but as mentioned, worth it for how incredibly well they execute the main function we need it for (effectively managing relationships/lists of contacts for both sales and client relationships)."

    "cons": "This is not a CRM period!  I would only recommend this if you were integrating it with a dedicated CRM system.  The notes are chaotic and very difficult to look back through history and find important past conversations.  There is no ability to do ANY form of contract management once a customer is closed and there is also no ability to attach anything to the opportunity info.  So if you have a relevant presentation or any documentation relevant to a potential sale you best save it in a google drive and make a custom field to stick the link in."

    "pros": "We use pipedrive for email marketing and Close.io for cold calling. Our system works like this. Our marketing team use pipedrive to send out email to possible leads and follow up with them and when it results in a successful response from the prospect the sales team collects the phone numbers. Then these prospects with phone numbers have been downloaded to csv and transferred to Close.io CRM for sales team. Then they do all the cold calling with in Close.io CRM. Our department also have access to this CRM to make support calls later on. We can say our sales team's productivity has increased a lot after implementing this CRM. They do not need to manually do the sorting and recording of calls made and everything can be done in settings just one time.",

Right now we are piloting Close.io here in the U.S. with a couple of sales people also trying it in Europe. We integrated our incoming leads from our system into close.io via Zapier and all communication via Gmail. It was a snap! Also, the support team can CC or BCC close.io on crucial matters via the ticket system and sales can now see all important transactions in one place.
