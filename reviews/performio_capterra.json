    "date": "3 years ago",

    "cons": "The Plan sign-off for the Users need some improvement because it's period based and lacks a pdf upload option.  From the admin side, the templates in the box solution should allow more flexibility without needing to find work arounds."

    "date": "3 years ago",
    "rating": 4,

There is no rhyme or reason to how it is listed now and it's a very detailed, cumbersome list.  Also header is always incorrect.   \nAnd finally, why can't our DIGAS commission be included in this report as well?"
