    "description": "What do you like best about PayPal?Been using paypal every week for the past 6 years, and obviously I cannot possibly have any complaints for using it this long.  PayPal's widespread acceptance makes it a convenient payment option for international transactions. Been using Paypal for many years, and all my clients prefer sending payments through this platform for its security and ease of use.  I personally had my paypal account integrated with my hubstaff account, and enjoyed the convenience in making may payments to my members, as I invoice them thru hubstaff.   I like it best when is terms of speed of transaction;  generally transactions are processed quickly, with funds often available instantly. What do you dislike about PayPal?PayPal's fees, especially for business transactions and currency conversions, can be relatively high compared to some other payment platforms.  Also have had my fair share of bad experienced, difficulties in resolving disputes or getting timely support.  Could have been better if chat support is made available for immediate concerns, specially in most cases it is all about widrawing funds. What problems is PayPal solving and how is that benefiting you?PayPal makes my life so much easier by tackling a few major headaches with online transactions. Handling international payments is a breeze with its currency conversion, saving me from extra fees. Plus, their buyer and seller protections ensure I'm covered if something goes wrong. ",

What do you dislike about PayPal?I don't see any downsides with using PayPal as I have been using it.

I like the way their customer service handles concerns with availabilty and understanding. They can explain the steps and solutions very well. They can also provide faster solutions in minutes! What do you dislike about PayPal?Maybe their dashboard because it's somewhat outdated in my own opinion. Their detail transactions aren't quite clear enough. There are details that I would like to see but it doesn't show in the dashboard. What problems is PayPal solving and how is that benefiting you?One problem is since CARD account numbers differ in each country, they did not put the proper instructions. Looking at the Paypal community, a lot of Filipino users tend to do it the wrong way because of lack of instructions. Hope they can rewrite it soon though. Their withdrawal fee is a bit of high sometimes, too. ",

They say you have buyer protection but don't do a thing when a purchase go astray, your on your own. Their entire company is handled by the Philippines and your not going to get one US based employee on the phone What do you dislike about PayPal?Everything, they do nothing but lie and then play games. Your money is theirs to do what they want and they could care less. PayPal is not a US company they are strictly off shore and they just send your money to the executives in the US. Worthless company. What problems is PayPal solving and how is that benefiting you?Nothing we fired them. ",

    "title": "PayPal for international money transfer",
    "description": "What do you like best about PayPal?It is one of the easiest and safest ways for international money transfers and receiving money from freelancer websites. It has a customer-friendly interface and clear instructions on its usability. On implementation, creating a PayPal account is easy and requires verification of documents like a National identification card or a passport for security purposes. On integration, a user can link their PayPal account to a bank account or a Visa card and use them to receive money. PayPal also responds to customer queries and concerns within 24 hours most of the time. It has features like holding funds for up to 21 days to ensure the safety of both the buyer and the seller, or rather the sender and the receiver. It has no limitation on the frequency of use per day, month, or year. What do you dislike about PayPal?One of the major problems associated with using PayPal is sudden account closure without a proper explanation of the terms broken or a proper window for appeal. Also freezing of funds for up to 21 days without considering the intention of the sender is also a major drawback. Sometimes, even with the intervention of the sender, PayPal doesn't release the money. Transacting a large amount of money on PayPal attracts huge fees. Dispute resolution is often ambiguous to the extent that the party trying to resolve an issue has to just give up. What problems is PayPal solving and how is that benefiting you?PayPal helps me receive payments from freelancer websites and grants ",

Now any other platform can give you a better and faster service What do you dislike about PayPal?I have made a withdrawal for less than I have many times before, and they're holding the money, they said it was 24 hours and it was a lie, then they said it was 72 hours, and that was yesterday. I ask for the money to be put back so I can use another platform and forget Paypal exists, they won't and state that 72 hours haven't passed since October 9th.

Charging fee for my own money? Just to transfer from one account to different.\n\nGap in their customers support communication with the user. PayPal occasional freeze accounts or hold funds for security reasons and worst thing is that there is no warning no prior alert for this and when account freeze no email, no information given until you contact to support team.\n\nPayPal should also accept local currency.

With PayPal, i can make transactions with just a few clicks, eliminating the need to enter my payment details every time i shop online. What do you dislike about PayPal?PayPal charges fees for certain types of transactions, such as receiving payments for goods and services or converting currencies. These fees can vary depending on factors like the transaction amount and the countries involved. While the fees are generally reasonable, they can add up, especially for businesses or frequent users. What problems is PayPal solving and how is that benefiting you?PayPal addresses the concern of sharing sensitive financial information with multiple online merchants. By using PayPal as an intermediary, i can keep my credit card or bank account details private and only provide them to PayPal. This reduces the risk of my information being compromised in data breaches or fraudulent transactions, providing an additional layer of security. ",
