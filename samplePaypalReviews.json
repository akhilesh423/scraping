I like the way their customer service handles concerns with availabilty and understanding. They can explain the steps and solutions very well. They can also provide faster solutions in minutes! What do you dislike about PayPal?Maybe their dashboard because it's somewhat outdated in my own opinion. Their detail transactions aren't quite clear enough. There are details that I would like to see but it doesn't show in the dashboard. What problems is PayPal solving and how is that benefiting you?One problem is since CARD account numbers differ in each country, they did not put the proper instructions. Looking at the Paypal community, a lot of Filipino users tend to do it the wrong way because of lack of instructions. Hope they can rewrite it soon though. Their withdrawal fee is a bit of high sometimes, too. ",
